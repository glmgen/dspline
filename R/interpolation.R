#' Discrete spline interpolation
#'
#' Interpolates a sequence of values within the "canonical" space of discrete 
#' splines of a given order, with respect to given design points.  
#'
#' @param v Vector to be values to be interpolated, one value per design point.
#' @param k Order for the discrete spline space. Must be >= 0.
#' @param xd Design points. Must be sorted in increasing order, and have length  
#'   at least `k+1`. 
#' @param x Query point(s), at which to perform interpolation.
#' @param implicit Should implicit form interpolation be used? See details for
#'   what this means. The default is `TRUE`.
#' @return Value(s) of the unique discrete spline interpolant (defined by the
#'   values `v` at design points `xd`) at query point(s) `x`. 
#' 
#' @details The "canonical" space of discrete splines of degree \eqn{k}, with
#'   respect to design points \eqn{x_{1:n}}, is spanned by the falling factorial
#'   basis functions \eqn{h^k_1, \ldots, h^k_n}, which are defined as:  
#'   \deqn{
#'   \begin{aligned}
#'   h^k_j(x) &= \frac{1}{(j-1)!} \prod_{\ell=1}^{j-1}(x-x_\ell), 
#'   \quad j=1,\ldots,k+1, \\
#'   h^k_j(x) &= \frac{1}{k!} \prod_{\ell=j-k}^{j-1} (x-x_\ell) \cdot  
#'   1\{x > x_{j-1}\}, \quad j=k+2,\ldots,n. 
#'   \end{aligned}
#'   }
#' Their span is a space of piecewise polynomials of degree \eqn{k} with knots
#'   in \eqn{x_{(k+1):(n-1)}}---in fact, not just any piecewise polynomials, but
#'   special ones that have continuous discrete derivatives (defined in terms of
#'   divided differences; see the help file for [discrete_deriv()] for the
#'   definition) of all orders \eqn{0, \ldots, k-1} at the knot points. This is
#'   precisely analogous to splines but with derivatives replaced by discrete
#'   derivatves, hence the name discrete splines. See Section 4.1 of Tibshirani
#'   (2020) for more details.
#'
#' As the space of discrete splines of degree \eqn{k} with knots in
#'   \eqn{x_{(k+1):(n-1)}} has linear dimension \eqn{n}, any sequence of \eqn{n}
#'   values (one at each of the design points \eqn{x_{1:n}}) has a unique
#'   discrete spline interpolant. Evaluating this interpolant at any query point
#'   \eqn{x} can be done via its falling factorial basis expansion, where the
#'   coefficients in this expansion can be computed efficiently (in \eqn{O(nk)}
#'   operations) due to the fact that the inverse falling factorial basis matrix
#'   can be represented in terms of extended discrete derivatives (see the help
#'   file for [h_mat_mult()] for details).
#'
#' When `implicit = FALSE`, the interpolation is carried out as described in the
#'   above paragraph. It is worth noting this is a strict generalization of
#'   **Newton's divided difference interpolation**, which is given by the
#'   special case when \eqn{n = k+1} (in this case the knot set is empty, and
#'   the "canonical" space of degree \eqn{k} discrete splines is nothing more
#'   than the space of degree \eqn{k} polynomials). See Section 5.3 of
#'   Tibshirani (2020) for more details.
#'
#' When `implicit = TRUE`, an implicit form is used to evaluate the interpolant
#'   at an arbitrary query point \eqn{x}, which locates \eqn{x} among the design
#'   points \eqn{x_{1:n}} (a \eqn{O(\log n)} computational cost), and solves for
#'   the of value of \eqn{f(x)} that results in a local order \eqn{k+1} discrete
#'   derivative being equal to zero (a \eqn{O(k)} computational cost). This is
#'   generally a more efficient and stable scheme for interpolation. See Section
#'   5.4 of Tibshirani (2020) for more details.
