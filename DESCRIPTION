Description: Discrete splines are a class of univariate piecewise polynomial 
    functions with close connections to divided differences and Newton 
    interpolation. Tools for computations relating to discrete splines --- 
    discrete differentiation and integration, various matrix computations with 
    discrete derivative or discrete spline bases matrices, and 
	interpolation within discrete spline spaces --- are provided.
