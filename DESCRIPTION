Description: Discrete splines are a class of univariate piecewise
    polynomial functions with close connections to divided differences and
    Newton interpolation. Tools for computations relating to discrete
    splines --- discrete differentiation and integration, various matrix
    computations with discrete derivative or discrete spline bases
    matrices, and interpolation within discrete spline spaces --- are
    provided.
