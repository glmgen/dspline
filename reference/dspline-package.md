# dspline: Tools for Computations with Discrete Splines

Discrete splines are a class of univariate piecewise polynomial
functions which are analogous to splines, but whose smoothness is
defined via divided differences rather than derivatives. Tools for
efficient computations relating to discrete splines are provided here.
These tools include discrete differentiation and integration, various
matrix computations with discrete derivative or discrete spline bases
matrices, and interpolation within discrete spline spaces. These
techniques are described in Tibshirani (2020)
