\title{Divided differencing}
\usage{
divided_diff(f, z)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{Function, or vector of function evaluations at the centers.}

\item{z}{Centers for the divided difference calculation.}
}
\value{
Divided difference of \code{f} with respect to centers \code{z}.
}
\description{
Computes the divided difference of a function (or vector of function
evaluations) with respect to given centers.
}
\details{
The divided difference of a function \eqn{f} with respect to centers
\eqn{z_1, \ldots, z_{k+1}} is defined recursively as:
\deqn{
  f[z_1,\ldots,z_{k+1}] = \displaystyle
  \frac{f[z_2,\ldots,z_{k+1}] - f[z_1,\ldots,z_k]}{z_{k+1}-z_1},
  }
with base case \eqn{f[z_1] = f(z_1)} (that is, divided differencing with
respect to a single point reduces to function evaluation).

A notable special case is when the centers are evenly-spaced, say, \eqn{z_i =
  z+ih}, \eqn{i=0,\ldots,k} for some spacing \eqn{h>0}, in which case the
divided difference becomes a (scaled) forward difference, or equivalently a
(scaled) backward difference,
\deqn{
  k! \cdot f[z,\ldots,z+kh] = \displaystyle
  \frac{1}{h^k} (F^k_h f)(z) =
  \frac{1}{h^k} (B^k_h f)(z+kh),
  }
where we use \eqn{F^k_h} and \eqn{B^k_v} to denote the forward and
backward difference operators, respectively, of order \eqn{k} and with
spacing \eqn{h}.
