These are *not* B-splines:

These are called *discrete* B-splines. They span a function spaced
called **discrete splines**, which are analogous to splines, but defined
in terms of a suitable discrete notion of smoothness.

- Discrete splines have continuous *discrete* derivatives at their knots
  (rather than continuous derivatives, as splines do).

- They have important computational properties, like the fact that
  interpolation within the space of discrete splines can be done in
  *constant-time*.

- They are intimately connected to trend filtering (they provide the
  basis representation that underlies the trend filtering estimator).

For more background, see the monograph: [“Divided differences, falling
factorials, and discrete splines: Another look at trend filtering and
related
problems”](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ryantibs/papers/dspline.pdf).

The `dspline` package provides tools for computations with discrete
splines. The core routines are written in C++ for efficiency. See the
[reference index](https://glmgen.github.io/dspline/reference/index.html)
for a summary of the tools that are available.
